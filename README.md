- `knn.py` - Implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classifier.

- `svm.py`- Implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

- `mgc_input` - Dataset pre-processing.

- `mgc_output` - Print predicted genre's to a text file.

- `reviews.py` - Main program to run the KNN and SVM models.

- `reviews.ipynb` - Main program to run the Bidirecional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, which was the best model tested and the one submitted.
